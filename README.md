# PROJECT REPO README TEMPLATE:
# [Project Display Name]

**Role:** [Your specific role] | **Platform:** [Key tech stack] | **Status:** [Active Development / Complete / In Progress]

**Context:** [One sentence - what this is and where it exists institutionally]

> [**Engineering Log**](ENGINEERING_LOG.md)

---

## 1. Project Overview

[3-4 sentences: what it does, why it exists, what problem it solves. Specific about technical contribution instead of just the application domain.]

---

## 2. System Architecture

[One high-level C4 context diagram pipeline or block diagram showing the full system, mermaid, the first thing a technical reader looks at. Pipeline projects (simulation, data processing) may additionally include a simplified data flow diagram below the C4 Context.]

## 3. [Core technical section, title varies by project]

[The technical heart of the project. Examples:
- Embedded Control State Machine (capstone)
- Haptic Teleoperation Pipeline (Isaac Sim)
- Soft Tissue Simulation (SOFA)
- Computer Vision Pipeline (MediaPipe)
Use mermaid diagrams where relevant.]

## 4. Key Parameters & Configuration

[Table of the most important settings, versions, pins, thresholds, SCANNABLE: not overdone config section (too overwhelming)]

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [param] | [value] | [brief reason] |

## 6. Results & Demos

[Embed demo GIF or link to YouTube video here once available, if not yet available, leave following as placeholder:]

*Demo video in progress -- check back as development continues.*

## 7. Engineering Retrospective

[2-3 sentences maximum:
1. The hardest constraint or most interesting technical decision
2. One concrete future iteration or known limitation

NOTE: This section is important as it is a direct showcase of AWARENESS and growth.]

## About

**Role:** [Your specific contribution -- precise, especially for team projects]
**Affiliation:** [Lab/Department/Course @ RPI]
**Supervisor:** [Professor name if applicable]
**Collaborators:** [Teammates if any, with their specific roles]
**Methodology:** [SE framework if applicable -- NASA SE, IEC 62304, ISO 14971] NOTE: Got feedback that this might be too much at this stage in career so maybe bench this for now
**Timeline:** [Start date - End date or Present]
